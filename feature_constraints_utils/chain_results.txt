of the 6**6 = 46656 possible VKCs, 5664 have full rank. Of them, 504 can be
separated into a positioning part (i.e. three joints that cover 3d positioning)
and an orientation part (i.e. three joints that cover orientations). Some chains
are kinematically equivalent when permuting some of the joint angles. Under this
equivalence, 2927 virtual chains are left.

These chains have at least one and at most three prismatic joints.

One p-joint:  spherical coordinates
Two p-joints: cylinder coordinates
Three p-joints: cartesian coordinates

It can be seen that still a lot of possible VKCs exist. Choosing the right one
is hard to formalize. It can be aided by semantic hints, such as object
symmetries.
